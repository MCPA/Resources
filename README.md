# Resources

This repository is designed to house all of our team resources, but does not include any custom software we have developed for competitions. Feel free to add, fork, or pull any public tools. Examples are included inside this repository. As we continue to expand our resources folder we may refine them based on categories.

Keep in mind that the preference is that if you add any source code that you include the compile options, operating system,  original author, and original site from which you found the public code. It is highly recommended that you go to https://archive.org/web/ and save the webpage in order to preserve the version of the website that you found.
