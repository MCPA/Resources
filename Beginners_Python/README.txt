Hi,

And welcome to my Course materials for Python for Informatics 
(www.pythonlearn.com) - I hope that you find them useful.  Everything
is Creative Commons Attribution unless otherwise indicated.

The folders are pretty self explanatory.  The videos are too large
to include in this file.  If you need to download them to serve them
locally, visit this page to download the individual videos:

The source code for the autograder is here:

You can play with the autograder at:

Let me know how it goes.
