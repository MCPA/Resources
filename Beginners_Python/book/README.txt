Hi,

Please point your students to the book page where all the latest 
formats can be downloaded at no charge.

If you open my site in a new window, you can use this URL:

http://www.pythonlearn.com/book.php

If you want ot put the book information in an iframe, use this URL:

http://www.pythonlearn.com/book.htm

You are welcome to download the electronic copies of the various formats of 
the book and host them in your learning management system, on a local server, 
or behind a firewall.

I am actively looking for collaborators willing to translate the book.
